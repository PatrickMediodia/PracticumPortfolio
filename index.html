                    <p>
                        Patrick took his internship at iRipple, Inc. iRipple is a solutions company that offers retail management software. It is located at Philippine Stock Exchange Centre, 2305 B Tektite East Tow, Exchange Rd, Pasig, Metro Manila. iRipple was established by Victor Javier and Hubert Dy in 2000 as a software development company that specializes in providing systems for the retail industry and gave birth to their main product, the Barter Point-of-Sales system. The mission of iRipple is to “Lead retailers to greatness through technology”, while their vision is for “Retailers are able to scale up and speed up using iRipple technology.”

                    <p>
                        Early clients of iRipple include businesses in different industries such as Super 8, GABC, and Primer. The clientele of iRipple later on expanded and now includes 7-11, Bonchon, Penshoppe, Chatime, and Gaisano to name a few. In the last few years, iRipple’s local clientele has continually expanded with retailers such as Celine, Asian Home Appliances, and Shakeys’ group of companies. iRipple also expanded internationally by offering services to international clients and establishing iRipple Malaysia and Thailand.

                    <p>
                        The main product of iRipple is the Barter System which is a sales and inventory software solution for retail management. Its functionality includes transaction management for back-office operations like ordering stocks, moving stocks from one site to another, etc. Managing product information through the product explorer. Point-of-Sales for actual selling of goods in store. And lastly, reports for sales, transactions, inventory, etc.

                    <h4 class="mt-5"> Nature of Tasks Given </h4>
                    <p>
                        During the internship, Patrick was under the B&Hi segment which is the Boutique & Home Improvement Segment. At first, he was assigned to update the user manual documentation of the Bater 8 system but he then expressed his interest and passion for software development to his adviser. With his adviser being the research and development team leader, Patrick was later moved to software development and documenting the modules he has created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two main types of tasks he did were software development and documentation which can vary from technical documentation to user manuals. Patrick was tasked to create and integrate new modules for the Barter 8 system to help solve its current problems which is one of the earlier systems created by iRipple dating to its initial development in 2008. Users of the Barter 8 system include Super8.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The technologies that were used during the internship were C# Desktop Forms for the desktop applications, Microsoft SQL Server for the branch server database, MS Access for the local database of the POS terminal, and Windows LAN network file sharing for the terminals to be able to communicate with the server and vice versa. ASP.NET Entity Framework was used as an Object Relational Mapper for the MSSQL database for easier manipulation of database data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patrick was able to develop and document five (5) modules namely: Two (2) report modules that were migrated and documented from Visual Basic 6 to C#, Point-of-Sales Terminal Monitoring, Point-of-Sales Software Auto Updater, and Point-of-Sales Records Synchronizer. The said modules will be further discussed in the presentation of the output section.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Total Hours Rendered</h4>
                    <p>
                        In total, as of the creation of this report on June 5, 2023, Patrick was able to complete a total of 470 hours. Four (4) hours were spent on the company orientation, and 24 hours on studying the documentation of the Barter 8 system. After that, he developed and documented the migration of VB6 reports with a total of 200 hours with development being 152 hours and documentation for 48 hours. Next, he created the Point-of-Sales Monitoring module with a development time of 96 hours and a documentation time of 16 hours. After that, he developed the Point-of-Sales Auto Updater which took him 72 hours to develop and 8 hours to create the user manual. Lastly, he was able to create the Point-of-Sales Records Synchronizer with a total of 50 hours. Patrick is scheduled to finish on June 7 and plans to spend his last 16 hours on the technical documentation of the POS records Sync Module.

                    <h4 class="mt-3">Migration of VB6 Report Modules to C#</h4>
                    <p>
                        The output of this task is to recreate two (2) Barter 8 report modules currently written in VB6 into C# and document the process of creation. This is because Patrick's supervisor wants to create all future Bater8 modules to be written in C#. The document output will then be used by developers in the future as a guide or sample when writing new functionality in C#. Shown below are the two report modules recreated. The POS Sales Journal Summary is the simpler form done as practice while the POS Collections Report is the more complex form with more filters and functionality.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/migration_modules/sales_journa_summary.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The POS Sales Journal Summary has filters such as picking the site from which to select terminals by clicking on “Change Site”, the from and to dates for the range of dates of the records, the type of transaction being: sales, returns, void, or all types, a filter for a specific terminal or all of the terminals, and arrange by transaction, OR, or invoice number. These filters will then be used for the query to get the desired transaction records.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/migration_modules/change_site.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 250px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #000000;">
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/migration_modules/collections_report.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Next, the POS collections report shown above is similar in that it also has a filter to select a specific site in which terminals to include, to and from dates of the sales transaction. Its difference from the first report form is that this only includes sales transactions, has a filter for the payment types to show, and has a group by filter with group by terminal, cashier, payment type, and site. The group by filter all has different queries which added to the complexity of this report for implementing it into printable reports and export to Excel. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data entered into these filters are then used in complex SQL queries which were from adopted from the original VB6 forms using SQL Server Profiler in order to capture the queries. These queries involve getting data from multiple tables and their respective relationships.

                    <p>
                        Both of these reports have the functionality of generating printable reports by clicking on the “Preview” or “Print Preview” link labels. Patrick used SAP Crystal Reports in order to generate printable reports. Each of the reports has a corresponding crystal report form as the data structure to be used in a crystal report form needs to be defined beforehand. A sample of the printable report can be seen above.

                    <p>
                        The difference between the two reports modules is that the POS collections report module has an export to Excel functionality. Patrickused the Interop microsoft office library to be able to interface with Microsoft Excel. Transaction records are iteratively written into an Excel file. Patrick used the cell’s address or reference to specify where to write a specific value or field. A sample of the export to Excel functionality can be seen in the picture below.

                    <p>
                        After the development of the two report modules, Patrick created its technical documentation. The photo below shows a sample of the technical documentation created by Patrick which is intended to be used by future developers as a guide. It includes information such as the tools used, setting up the project, the project structure, as well as a specific discussion on how each part of the functionality was created namely the data models, the startup parameters, retrieving and saving data to the registry, crystal reports, and exporting to excel.

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Point-of-Sales Monitoring Module</h4>
                    <p>
                        Next, Patrick was tasked to create new modules that will help with the current problems of the system. First, he created a module to monitor the point-of-Sales terminals. This was created in order for a supervisor to be able to monitor terminals in a single view and check if there are problems so that it can quickly be resolved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The photo shows the monitoring dashboard. Its default behavior upon opening is showing only the online POS terminals, it also has options of showing the offline terminals under the options tab. Terminals are asynchronously pinged through the LAN connection using their terminal names, and if they reply, it means they are online. Terminal statuses are refreshed every 60 seconds (1 minute) with a timer shown at the top right. A user is also able to manually refresh the status of the terminals in the options tab without waiting for the automatic refresh timer.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/monitoring/dashboard.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #000000;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The monitoring dashboard also includes data such as the cashier logged in, the number of unsent transactions which means the difference between the count of the records found in the branch server versus in the local database of the terminal, and a summary of the sales, returns, and voided transactions of a specific terminal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The photo below shows the viewing of all transactions for that day per terminal. This was created as he was tasked by the supervisor as a challenge and an exercise to add a functionality that he thinks is beneficial and helpful for the user of this module. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patrick thought that since there is a summary of transactions, there should be a way of viewing all the transactions of a specific terminal for that day. This functionality also includes searching records by transaction number, transaction type, status, cashier name, or amount.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The functionality of the POS monitoring module also includes authorizing requests that need supervisor credentials. This allows supervisors to give authorization without having to go to the actual terminal. This works by the terminal sending a request to the branch server, the branch server which the monitoring module is running on in the backend is then notified of this request. The supervisor is notified by highlighting the terminal color yellow and playing a sound. To authorize the request, the user must click on the terminal and enter their supervisor's user code and password. These credentials are then sent to the terminal to be processed and used to authorize the request (see photo below).
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        After the development of the monitoring module, Patrick created its technical documentation. The document below shows a sample of the technical documentation created by him. It includes information such as an overview of the module functionality, the tools used, setting up the project, the project structure, as well as a specific discussion on how each part of the functionality was created namely the data models, getting and pinging the terminals, refreshing the terminal status, getting transaction data, and the authorization of the supervisor and their credentials.

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Point-of-Sales Auto Updater Module</h4>
                    <p>
                        Currently, updates on Barter 8 point-of-sales terminals are manually installed by accessing the terminals one by one remotely and changing the program files and folders. According to his supervisor, this can take around 5 to 10 minutes per terminal depending on the size of the update. In a hypothetical situation of 10 sites with 10 terminals, the software support team would need to remotely access 100 terminals per software update. Although this is a legacy system and updates are not that often, this manual operation is tedious and is prone to human errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main problem that the point-of-sales auto-updater module developed by Patrick solves is to check if there are software updates from the branch server. If updates are present, it then automatically updates its files and folders, while also creating backups of the overwritten files. These backups can then be used as restore or rollback points as needed. The point-of-sales auto-updater module developed by Patrick removes the need for manually updating the terminals one by one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Going back to the hypothetical situation of 10 sites with 10 terminals each, the software support team would only need to remotely access the 10 branch servers and upload the updated files there. This will then be automatically installed by the auto-updater module on the startup of the terminals. The point-of-sales terminal updates are put in the POS_Updates folder on the Branch Server. The POS Auto Updater on the terminals checks the POS_Updates folder on the branch server. The name of the folder is used as the backup name or title as a way to descriptively identify updates (see photo below).
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/auto_updater/update_path.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #000000;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Shown below is the point-of-sales auto-updater module updating the files of the local terminal from the branch server. This is added as a task on the Windows task scheduler on user login. The user interface was created to match the design of the legacy point-of-sales system the module was to be integrated into.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        After updates have been checked and installed, the Barter point-of-sales terminal program is run. The Barter POS auto-updater module is then hidden in the system tray. This allows the program to be run in the background. In order to show the program, the user needs to double-click on the icon found in the system tray.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/auto_updater/system_tray.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 250px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #000000;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Barter POS auto-updater module also has functionality for restoring or rolling back backups. Backups can be found in the POS_Update_Backups folder on the terminal and are stored in a zip file. Backups older than the AutoCleanupDaysLimit field stored on the terminal which in this case was set to 90 days were deleted to save on space. The photo below shows the restoration of the backup user interface. It shows a table of the name of the backup which was taken from the name of the update folder as well as the date and time the update was installed.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        To restore a backup, double-click on your desired backup to roll back. A prompt will then show confirming the decision of the user to restore the backup.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If the user selects yes, a prompt for supervisor credentials will be shown, this is because only supervisors are able to roll back updates on the terminals as needed.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/auto_updater/credentials.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #000000;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If correct supervisor credentials have been entered to authorize the rollback of an update, it will start the operation. The figure down below shows the prompt that will display once the restoration of a backup is complete.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        After the development of the module, Patrick was asked to create a user manual. As of the moment of writing this report June 2, 2023, Patrick's supervisor plans to code review and pass the program to be checked by QA in the hopes of being used in production. The user manual highlights the functionality, installation process on the terminal, and how to load the updates on the branch server to be checked by the auto-updater module installed on the terminals (see photo below).
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>


                    <h4 class="mt-5">Point-of-Sales Records Sync Module</h4>
                    <p>
                        As a quick overview, local terminal transaction records are sent to the branch server after every transaction. However, the local MS Access MDB file database of a terminal sometimes gets corrupted and its records are lost. This is a problem as the transactions on the terminals will not match the transactions on the server. This is especially problematic when the transaction ids on the local are reset and cause an error as these transaction ids might already be used in the server. Furthermore, an accurate balancing of records must be kept so that reports of sales, returns, and voided transactions are accurate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To remedy this, the current process of the system support team is to manually update and synchronize the lost records on the terminal. Either they (1) manually repeat and recreate the transactions through the POS terminal software or they (2) transfer the server transaction records through SQL commands (see photo below). Both of these approaches typically result in a downtime of 15 minutes at best and could take hours in the worst-case scenario. Moreover, this manual approach is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error as each transaction table, namely header, items, and payment has a total of over 100 fields.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="assets/img/auto_sync/sample_data.png" class="img-fluid mt-1 mb-1" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #000000;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The module developed by Patrick remedies this by checking for transactions that are present on the server that is not on the local database of the terminals. It then inserts these transaction records to rectify the lost data. The photo below shows the initial screen of the module. It accepts from and to date ranges to filter and narrow down the records to be checked and synchronized by the module.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The photo below shows what happens when the check records button is been pressed. It will first show a summary of the number of records in the database of the local point-of-sales terminal and the branch server.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If there are more server records than local point-of-sales terminal records, the program will prompt the user if they want to transfer the records not found on the local terminal that are on the server. The message also reminds the user that this action is permanent and cannot be undone.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container mb-3" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                    <p>
                        Once the operation is complete, a message box will show that the program has finished transferring the records found on the server into the terminal.

                    <p>
                        First, Patrick was able to learn a lot about systems that are actually being used in production environments. He was able to interact with production software that is being used by multiple big and well-known businesses such as Super8. He learned about the process of software systems such as inventory management systems and point-of-sales terminals like how orders for stocks are placed and processed, product items management, what is X-reading and Z-reading in point-of-sales systems, and so on. From there he was also able to learn about production infrastructure and systems design. The system he interacted with which is the Barter 8 system follows a distributed approach where the local transactions are first saved on the terminals and are then sent to the branch server to be saved. This means that the records per site are stored in their corresponding branch server and not a centralized server for all of the sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for technical skills, he was able to learn how to be able to develop modules that integrate into existing large-scale system systems that are used in production. At school, he was used to creating systems from the ground up, which means that he was always the one creating the database structure and the structure of the program to be developed. He was able to gain experience working on the constraints set by other people on how data should be stored and how programs should be structured. Furthermore, he learned and practiced how to make code more readable and reusable through code reviews from his supervisor. This is important since other developers are also going to look at the code he wrote and is to be maintained by other programmers.

                    <p>
                        Due to the nature of his tasks, he was also able to refresh his knowledge of C# programming desktop applications as well as his learnings in databases using SQL that he learned from the courses he took. He was also able to build upon this existing knowledge by exploring different libraries and frameworks to make a more robust and well-functioning system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from software development, Patrick also learned how to create technical documentation as a guide for developers or users of the system he has created. He was able to document his development process and his thoughts on why he took a certain approach in order for other developers to understand. As for user manuals, he was able to create manuals for new users to follow so that they know how to use the system. Although he has experience in creating documentation for systems he has developed in his school projects, none of them were this large of a scope, detailed, and in-depth in order to make the reader understand the system easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from technical skills, he also learned about the different soft skills needed in the workplace. One such important soft skill is how to communicate with your co-workers. This includes only using words that should be used in a professional setting in all forms of communication such as written messages, voice calls, and emails. Furthermore, Patrick also learned to write concise and straight-to-the-point messages in order to convey the message clearly to the receiver. Furthermore, he also learned to wait patiently for the response of the person he sent a message to as they also have their own work and tasks that they need to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from communication, Patrick also learned about time management. This was how he was able to deliver modules and requirements set by his adviser on time. Since he also was taking his Capstone during his practicum internship, he had to juggle his time and attention to two very important matters. He was able to do this by making sure that he is not distracted during his shift and that he also had the discipline to do his other work and important matters outside of office hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patrick also learned how to fight the feeling of being overwhelmed. He felt overwhelmed whenever a new module or task was given to him. He remediated this by breaking down these large daunting tasks into smaller more manageable, workable, and quantifiable tasks. From there he also always thought that his first iteration of work does not have to be perfect from the start. First, he can make it work, and then iteratively improve upon it. When stuck on a task, he also asked for help from his supervisor. This is of course after he has tried and exhausted all the possible solutions he has come up with.

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Realizations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Through this internship experience, Patrick realized that even though the projects and assignments being done in school are challenging, there is still a large gap in difficulty between actual real-world applications. That being said, he believes that the learnings he has acquired and projects he has done in school have prepared him for the challenges in the actual workplace. He just has to take the next step and improve upon the foundation of knowledge he has gained from school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This internship experience also led him to realize that he wants to pursue a career in the field of software development. The reason he accepted this internship in the first place rather than going through the learning path is to get a feel of a day in the life of a software developer and the pros and cons that comes with it. Even though there may be tough times, Patrick realized his passion for creating software that is tangible and that users can use that will help their day-to-day operations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patrick also realized that he still has a long way to go and has a lot more to learn. He felt that although his outputs have hit the objectives set by the supervisor, the way the code was written in terms of its readability, efficiency, and reusability still has room for improvement. This realization motivated Patrick to learn more about best practices in software development after the internship practicum was over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, Patrick also realized the importance of a good mentor. His supervisor was able to guide him to learn every single step of the way. He gave Patrick enough space to learn and experience things on their own while also stepping in to help when needed
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, Patrick was glad he took the internship opportunity as it gave him a glimpse into the work of a software developer. It has made him realize his strengths and weaknesses which is vital to help him prepare for his future jobs. Furthermore, a competent employee not only has technical skills but also soft skills. This opportunity gave him experience and practiced his soft skills in interacting with people in the company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, Patrick would like to thank iRipple, Inc. for this wonderful opportunity and the learnings and experience it came with. Being able to work on production systems has opened his eyes to the possibilities and hardships of working with actual clients to meet their needs. Patrick's adviser also expressed their appreciation to him by offering a job position on his team if he decides to apply to this company. Patrick is grateful for this opportunity and is considering it once he graduates.
